Analysing Thanks Giving Dinner in the US 2015


Data is from a survey conducted by [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-your-part-of-america-eats-on-thanksgiving/) and available [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015).


Here, I examined the main dishes, the type of pie people eat and the rate of attending thanks giving dinner by people of different age groups. I also explored the correlation between the distance people travel for thanksgiving dinner and their income, and the relationship between travel distance and age.

I also explored how the main dish is cooked and the number of people who work on thanksgiving day.
